# Welcome
Check out the self contained [jupyter notebook](monte_carlo_mass_transport_d17397nr.ipynb) for notes about pseudo-random numbers, isotropic random walks in 3D, simulations of neutrons in different media.<br>
It's recommended to download the notebook yourself, then to run all cells, before reading the sections you are interested in.
